        <h2>About Teppakulam</h2>
        <p>
            The <span class="highlight">Trichy Teppakulam</span>, also known as the Mariamman Teppakulam, is a sacred 
            tank located near the Rockfort Temple in Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu. This magnificent tank is an 
            architectural and cultural landmark, believed to have been built during the Nayak period. It spans a vast area 
            and features a central mandapam with a shrine dedicated to Lord Vinayaka.
        </p>
        <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
        <p>
            Teppakulam was excavated by the orders of King Thirumalai Nayak in the 17th century, using soil from the tank 
            to construct the iconic Rockfort Temple. The tank symbolizes the ingenuity of ancient engineering and the 
            dedication to temple architecture during that era.
        </p>
        <h2>Float Festival (Teppam)</h2>
        <p>
            One of the main attractions of the Teppakulam is the annual <em>Teppam Festival</em>, celebrated with grandeur 
            and devotion. During this festival, deities from nearby temples are placed on ornately decorated floats and 
            taken around the tank. The sight of the illuminated floats on the water during the festival is mesmerizing and 
            attracts devotees and tourists alike.
